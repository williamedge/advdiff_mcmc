# advdiff_mcmc
Estimate parameters from a 1-D advection diffusion equation using MCMC sampling. 

Code needs cleaning up. Basic functions are in edge_funcs.py. Notebooks show example code for each case study. Forcing data is in CSV (case study 1) or netcdf (case study 3). All forcing and fitting files should be picked up automatically by the notebooks. 



To do: add Bilby MCMC example and make Bilby the new default method.
